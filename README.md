# ElectroWave Simulacrum

## Introduction

Welcome to ElectroWave Simulacrum â€“ a MATLAB project that delves into the fascinating realm of short transmission line simulation. This project leverages MATLAB's powerful capabilities to provide a thorough understanding of the behavior and dynamics of short transmission lines.

## Project Overview

### Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to simulate and analyze short transmission lines, unraveling their complex characteristics. MATLAB's simulation capabilities allow for a detailed exploration of electrical transmission dynamics, shedding light on the intricacies of short lines.

### Features

- **Transmission Line Modeling**: Accurate modeling of short transmission lines for realistic simulation results.
- **Parameter Variation**: Explore the impact of varying parameters on the performance of short transmission lines.
- **Transient Analysis**: Delve into transient responses to understand the dynamic behavior of the transmission lines.
- **Graphical Representation**: Visualize simulation results through comprehensive graphs and plots.

## Getting Started

To initiate the simulation, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure that you have MATLAB installed on your system.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/electrowave-simulacrum.git
   ```
3. **Open MATLAB**: Launch MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
4. **Run the Main Script**: Execute the main script (`main_simulation.m`) to initiate the simulation.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **`main_simulation.m`**: The main script for initiating the simulation.
- **`functions/`**: Contains MATLAB functions for various aspects of the simulation.
- **`results/`**: Store simulation results and graphical outputs.
